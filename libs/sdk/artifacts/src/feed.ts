 * depth, a diagram's source and its description, a clip's poster and where it plays. So the feed
 * is a projection of `content/{hash}.json` and needs nothing the bucket does not already hold,
 * which is why it is assembled at request time rather than published as a tenth object.
 *
 * It lives beside the schemas rather than in the compiler because both sides need it: the
 * compiler to keep emitting the same bytes, and the Worker to build a document out of objects it
 * fetched. See spec/architecture/artifacts.md, "Which objects exist".
