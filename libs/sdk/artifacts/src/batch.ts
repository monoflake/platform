 * A single lookup is a `GET` with its identifiers in the query; asking about many things is a
 * `POST` carrying a list, because a list does not belong in a URL. That left the API growing one
 * route per batchable question -- `/views`, `/read-counts` -- each a second spelling of a question
 * already answered singly, and each needing its own name.
 *
 * So there is one route, `POST /batch`, and the body says which question it is. `type` selects the
 * module that reads the rest; adding a batchable question adds a variant here and a handler there,
 * and no route at all. See spec/architecture/artifacts.md, "One batch entry point".
