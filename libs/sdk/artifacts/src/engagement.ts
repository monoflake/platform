/**
 * What the engagement API answers, as schemas rather than as types.
 *
 * These are the answers a browser reads, and a browser is reading something it did not produce --
 * across a network, from a Worker deployed on its own schedule. A type says what should arrive; a
 * schema is the only thing that says what did. The corpus answers are checked by their envelope
 * instead, which is cheaper and is all a content-addressed object needs; nothing here is
 * content-addressed. See spec/architecture/artifacts.md, "Validation is heavy where it is free".
 *
 * Shared because both sides want the same sentence: the Worker builds an answer that satisfies
 * the inferred type, and the browser parses what arrives against the schema it was inferred from.
