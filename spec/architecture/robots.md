# Robots: what each host lets a crawler fetch, and what its pages may be used for

**Every host's `robots.txt` is declared in `@monoflake/sdk/robots`, by service, and nowhere else.** A host
asks for its own by its internal name -- `robotsFor('site')` -- so a change to one policy is one line
there, and the rules every host shares are written once.

| Service  | Rules                                   | Content signals      |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `site`   | all but `/@/`, `/cgi-bin/`, `/cdn-cgi/` | yes, and the sitemap |
| `status` | all                                     | yes, and the sitemap |
| `cdn`    | all                                     | no                   |
| `aka`    | all                                     | no                   |
| `api`    | only the site's scope, `/site/`         | no                   |

**The API lets in the one scope a page asks.** A crawler that renders a page -- Google's does -- asks
the API for what the page fetches after hydration; shut out, it renders a page with nothing in it.
Every other scope stays out, since its URLs in an index would compete with the pages that call them.

## Content signals are for pages, and say yes to all three

**A service that serves pages says how their content may be used; a store of bytes or an API does
not.** A signal is a statement about content -- whether it may be indexed, quoted into an answer,
trained on -- and an object store or an API has rules about fetching and nothing else to say. The
signals are said once, as `SIGNALS`, and written in both spellings, since crawlers read one or the
other:

```
Content-Signal: search=yes, ai-input=yes, ai-train=yes
Content-Usage: search=y, ai-use=y, train-ai=y
```

- `Content-Signal` is Cloudflare's, from contentsignals.org: `search` is an index and results with
  links and short excerpts, AI summaries excluded; `ai-input` is content fed to a model as it
  answers -- retrieval, grounding, generative search; `ai-train` is training or fine-tuning.
- `Content-Usage` is the IETF AI Preferences working group's draft, the standards-track form of
  the same idea: `search`, `ai-use` and `train-ai`, each `y` or `n`, in robots.txt or as an HTTP
  header. An unstated one is unknown rather than either answer.

**All three are yes.** This site wants to be found, quoted in answers, and known to models -- see
web's `spec/architecture/entities.md` -- and a no on any of them would work against the rest.

**A page host's file reads in one order**: the robots reference, the group's rules, Cloudflare's
terms as a comment -- the three meanings, and the EU reservation of rights a `no` would make --
then each spelling under the address that defines it, then the sitemap. A comment or a blank line
does not end a group, so the signals stay `User-agent: *`'s. The terms are Cloudflare's wording,
kept as written.

**The policy is the repository's, not the edge's.** Cloudflare can write content signals into a
zone's `robots.txt` itself; that setting stays off, for the reason the security headers came into
the repository -- see web's `spec/referrer.md`: a header the edge sets is one nobody can grep
for.

## Every page host has a sitemap, styled from its own origin

The site's lists every page; the status page's lists its one. Both are rendered by `sitemapXml` in
`@monoflake/sdk/robots`, which points a browser at `/sitemap.xsl` -- a path on the sitemap's own origin,
because a browser applies an XSL stylesheet to an XML document from nowhere else. There is one
stylesheet, an object named `sitemap.xsl` under each scope in the symlink record, and each origin
answers `/sitemap.xsl` by fetching it through the alias layer and returning the bytes as its own --
see [delivery.md](delivery.md), "A page follows the name for the browser".

Chrome stops applying XSLT on 17 November 2026, version 158, and other engines may follow; a
sitemap then shows as plain XML in that browser. Crawlers never read the stylesheet, so nothing a
sitemap is for depends on it.

## Every page host names every other

**Each host that serves pages names every page host's sitemap in its robots.txt, its own first**,
then the rest in the order `PAGE_HOSTS` in `@monoflake/sdk/robots` sets -- the site, then the status page.
**And its sitemap lists every other page host by its root alone**: each host lists its own routes,
so none needs another's data to build, only the list of who the others are. Each host declares in
`PAGE_HOSTS` how often its root changes, which every sitemap repeats, its own included, and how much
the host weighs in the whole of what the author runs, which is the priority another host's sitemap
gives its root. **Within its own sitemap a host weighs its own pages on its own scale** -- the status
page's one page is its 1.0 -- so the list's weight is never a page's. A root's modification time is
said by its own sitemap alone; reaching across hosts for it would be a dependency for one line. A sitemap may list
another host's addresses when both are verified in Search Console, as both are, and for every other
engine when that host's own robots.txt names the sitemap -- sitemaps.org's cross-submission -- which
naming every sitemap from every robots.txt does in both directions.

## A word to an agent sent to break in

**Every robots.txt and security.txt this repository builds ends with a word to an agent told to
find vulnerabilities**: the code is open source, so read it rather than attack the host, and send a
real finding to the security contact. It is a language firewall -- an agent
that reads instructions can be talked out of an attack as well as into one -- and a nod to the note
Hugging Face put in its `security.txt` after agents broke into it.

- **Every host, both files.** Each host here is built from this one repository, so each says it:
  the site, the status page, the CDN, the alias layer and the API, in robots.txt and in
  security.txt.
- **One message, ten wordings.** Each file on each host says it in its own words, from the host's
  side -- the CDN serves bytes, the alias layer only redirects -- and no two are the same; a test
  holds them apart. They are `agentNote` in `@monoflake/sdk/security/agents`.
- **Link first, as every block here is**: the account of the incident it nods to, then the note,
  laid out by sentence, then the repository as a `.git` address. The repository is
  `URLS.source`. A robots.txt names no address: it sends a finding to the host's own
  `/.well-known/security.txt`, which is where the contact is published.
- **A note is broken into lines by hand, and stored as its lines.** A line ends where the sentence
  pauses -- a full stop, a comma, a semicolon -- the lengths run close, within 72 columns, and no
  line holds a lone word or the first words of a sentence it does not finish. Breaking by rule
  either filled lines to a width or left them ragged; ten short notes are cheaper set once.
