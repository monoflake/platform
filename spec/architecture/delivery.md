# Reaching a reader

## Formats are produced here, not at the edge

Cloudflare's image transformations cannot read AVIF below an Enterprise plan, and even there
the source is capped at 1200px while these variants go to 1920. The format chosen for storage
is the one format that pipeline cannot open. Measured: an AVIF source returns
`ERROR 9520: Original image has unsupported format` where the identical request against a PNG
source succeeds.

So the CDN decodes and re-encodes in the worker, using WASM codecs. That removes the plan
tier, the monthly quota and the dimension ceiling together, and the cost is bounded because
the extension is the entire request -- there is no size parameter to vary, so a caller cannot
invent work. Results are held in the edge cache, so the decode is paid once per colo rather
than once per reader.

Only the decoders for what is stored and the encoders for what is asked for. **The AVIF encoder
was deliberately absent and now is not, on one route.** It was argued out on its size -- 1.1MB
compressed against 332KB for the decoder -- and on `local image` already producing AVIF locally
where the time costs nothing. The first half was measured against the wrong number: the limit is
64MiB uncompressed and nothing compressed, and the bundle carrying it is 5.7MB.

The second half still holds, and `/derive` is now the only route that converts anything, so the
encoder has nowhere else it could be. `/object` hands back what is stored and refuses what is
not: a flat-colour original written as PNG has no AVIF to serve, and `/object/{cid}.avif`
answering 404 for it is a fact about the bucket that a caller can act on rather than a conversion
happening quietly.

### Rejected: loading a codec per route

Five `.wasm` modules are 5244.8 KiB of a 5796.91 KiB bundle -- 90.5% -- and only one of them is
wanted on any given request, so importing each one where it is used reads as the obvious saving.
It saves nothing, for two reasons that are independent and each sufficient on its own.

**The runtime does not consult the import graph.** workerd's default module registry compiles
every module in the bundle at `Worker::Script` construction, reached or not:
_"The legacy registry eagerly compiled all worker bundle ESM modules at startup"_
([legacy-module-registry.md](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/blob/main/docs/reference/detail/legacy-module-registry.md)).
A module nothing imports still costs its compile and its memory, once per isolate replica.

**And the bundler hoists a `.wasm` import out of a dynamically imported module.** Measured with
wrangler 4 against this project's own compatibility date: a `.wasm` imported by a module reachable
only through `await import()` is emitted at the entry's top level as a static `import`
declaration, which ESM grammar permits nowhere else. The JavaScript around it is deferred --
esbuild wraps it in an `__esm` closure -- but the codec is not. So even with a registry that
compiled lazily, first import would still be entry evaluation, which is startup.

**The saving that exists was already taken**, and `transcode.ts` says so where it is made: an
imported `.wasm` is a compiled `WebAssembly.Module` and instantiation is a separate call, which
`once()` defers per codec into the request path. Instantiation is the expensive half. What
dynamic import could still move is that file's top-level body -- a class declaration and six
closures -- against a startup budget of one second.

**Nor is the size itself costing anything.** 5.66 MiB against 64 MiB, nothing charged per
request, and the eager compile is a baseline Liftoff pass with optimisation tiering up on a
background thread rather than a full compile of 5.2 MiB.

**If startup is ever suspected, measure before changing anything**: `startup_time_ms` from
`wrangler deploy` or `wrangler versions upload`, or `wrangler check startup`. The
`new_module_registry` compatibility flag is not the answer -- its lazy compile does not bite
while the five are in the entry's static graph, and its compile-cache advantage is over ESM
bytecode, where the legacy path already shares compiled wasm between isolates. It also changes
CJS interop semantics, which this bundle depends on. The only change that takes the 90% off this
worker's startup is moving the codecs behind a service binding, which is the split the
[limits page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/) names for exactly this.
That is reasoning from the two rules above rather than something anybody has run.

## Where the syntax colours are resolved

A code block is highlighted while its article is compiled, and the colours are stored in the
published object. Changing the syntax theme is therefore a recompilation of the corpus, not a
deploy -- the friction that prompted the measurements below, all of them gzipped, because Shiki's
output is repetitive enough that raw sizes mislead by a factor of five.

|                                                             | gzipped |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| The heaviest article's code, bare                           | 0.96 KB |
| The same, with the colours baked in                         | 2.15 KB |
| The same, as a theme of CSS variables                       | 1.78 KB |
| The same, as classes naming each token's scope set          | 2.16 KB |
| Grammars for the ten languages, were they sent to a browser | 63 KB   |
| The two themes, likewise                                    | 7 KB    |

**Deferring the colour is free, and moving the renderer is not.** The three artifact shapes land
within a fifth of a kilobyte of each other, so the choice between them is about palette fidelity
rather than bytes. Rendering in the browser instead is a different order of question: one reader
would fetch more grammar than the entire corpus spends on baked colour, to save 1.5 KB on the
article in front of them. It also cannot be avoided by rendering on the server alone, because
after hydration this site's articles are rendered by the browser and not by the Worker --
[artifacts.md](artifacts.md), "Two consumers, and the second one is the browser".

**What deferring would buy is a theme change that is a deploy.** Neither deferred shape needs a
renderer at the edge or in the page: a colour resolved from a class is a stylesheet's job, so the
SSR and CSR paths would stay identical. The cheap shape collapses the palette to about a dozen
token kinds; the faithful one keys on each token's scope set, which is nearly one key per token
today -- 448 sets over 697 tokens, a 1.6 KB table for the whole corpus, growing with it. That
table is also first-load CSS, and the article route has around 1.4 KB of budget left, which is the
first thing that route would have to answer for. Nothing here is decided; the current cost of a
theme change is one `publish`.

## Two routes, and what each will not do

`/object/{cid}.{ext}` is the whole of content addressing with nothing added: it forms the key,
reads, and answers. No probe, no synthesis, no outbound request. It is the one route on this host
that keeps its year on a property rather than a promise.

`/derive/{cid}.{ext}.{ext}` is where every transcoding lives, present and future. The source
extension is stated rather than searched for -- this route is told the full name of what to work
from, so it never probes, and it asks the same lookup `/object` uses by calling it rather than by
fetching its own hostname, which would spend a subrequest and invite a loop.

| asked for                                         | answered                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| a source that is not in the bucket                | `404`, before any byte is read                         |
| the same extension twice                          | `301` to `/object`, because there is no work to do     |

| an image format from a decodable source           | the transcode                                          |
| `zip`, source under the cap                       | the object packaged, stored rather than deflated       |
| `zip`, source over the cap                        | `413 too_large_to_package`                             |
| `zip` with a `Range`, source over the seeking cap | `413 too_large_to_seek`                                |
| anything else                                     | `400`                                                  |

**A `3xx` here earns the year, which no other route on this host grants it.** Everywhere else a
redirect is a fact about now; on these two it is a function of the input and can no more change
than the bytes can. The rule is `2xx` or `3xx` keeps the year, everything else keeps five minutes.

**Two caps and two refusals, because they are two different answers.** A full request streams, so
it holds only the chunk in flight and the cap is 50MB. A ranged one cannot: a zip's checksum
covers all of its data and is written after it, so even a range naming the first byte has to read
the last, and the archive is built whole before it is sliced. That path's cap is half the other,
so the peak it reaches is the same number the streaming path passes through an isolate that has
128MB for its heap and its WebAssembly together and may already be holding a codec. The two
messages differ because `too_large_to_package` for a request that would have succeeded without a
`Range` header tells a client nothing it can act on.

**The archive is streamed and its timestamp is not a clock.** Entries are stored, not deflated --
these are already-compressed media and deflate would spend CPU to add bytes -- and the source is
capped at 50MB, checked against a `head` before anything is read, because an isolate has 128MB for
its heap and its WebAssembly together and may already be holding a codec. A fixed epoch rather
than the hour it was asked for, because a response served `immutable` has to be a function of its
input, and a clock in the bytes would make the same request return different archives.

## The extension asks for a format

**AVIF is the usual storage format, not the only one.** This section said only AVIF is stored
and that was wrong: `local image` writes a flat-colour original as PNG, because lossy coding is
the wrong tool for it. An article cannot get this wrong from its side, because a reference names
a resource id and carries no format at all -- which format the CDN serves is settled at compile
time from the record. So `/object/{cid}.avif` and
`/object/{cid}.png` are each a direct hit or a refusal, and nothing probes for the other: the
worker used to try every decodable format to find out which one was written, and `/derive` is
told the source in full instead. Asking for an AVIF that was never written is a 404, which is
what a caller needs to hear.

An extension that is not the stored one is a request to convert that same object, which the
worker satisfies itself: the decode-and-re-encode path in `transcode.ts` described above, not
Cloudflare's image transformations, which the previous section already ruled out for not being
able to read AVIF at all. That also corrects an earlier version of this section, which reasoned
about that pipeline's per-image conversion counting; the worker has never called it.

The conversion instead costs one decode and one encode per requested format, held in the edge
cache afterward so it is paid once per colo rather than once per reader -- the same accounting
the section above gives for the AVIF-to-storage-format case, now applied to AVIF-to-fallback.
Storage would be nearly free either way -- what a stored fallback really costs is the sync, the
derive time, and a second thing to keep consistent.

No `?format=` parameter, because the extension already says which format is wanted and two
spellings of one request fragment the cache key.

**And for the same reason there is no `.jpg`.** It is not a second format, it is JPEG written
for an eight-character filename limit that outlived the system that imposed it -- the history
that leaves `yml` beside `yaml`. Carried as one, it would fragment exactly what the paragraph
above refuses to fragment: two validators, two edge entries and two conversions over identical
bytes.

**It is pinned in two places, and only one of them is a redirect.** Writing is narrow: `local image`
and `local favicon` both name a published file `.jpeg`, while `mime_of` still accepts a `.jpg` on
the way in, so the short spelling can never be a stored key. Reading is where the correction
lives: `/derive/{cid}.avif.jpg` answers a permanent redirect to the `.jpeg` spelling, so a reader
pays one hop once and their browser never asks again.

**The source half needs no rule, which is the point of the first pin.**
`/derive/{cid}.jpg.webp` looks up `{cid}.jpg`, which writing guarantees is not a key, so it is an
ordinary `404`. Normalising there too would be worse than redundant: it would serve a JPEG's bytes
under a key the bucket does not hold, and nothing would report it. `/object` corrects nothing
either -- the extension is part of the key there, and a key names bytes or it does not.

**Nothing here generates the short spelling**, which is what keeps that lookup off the ordinary
path: `local image` names a published file `.jpeg` and writes that name into the article, and the
site's asset resolver builds the same one. Both spelled it `jpg` until the correction existed to
catch them, which would have made every JPEG this repository serves pay a hop meant for somebody
else's typo -- invisible from either side alone, since the CDN and the article each looked right.
A test on each side holds the two spellings together, and a third holds that a `.jpg` _source_ is
refused rather than quietly rewritten.

The extension also caps the exposure, and that argument stands on its own: only a size that was
derived exists as an object, so nobody can invent dimensions and make the worker encode whatever
they ask for. The reachable set is the stored ids crossed with the three encodable extensions,
and each answer is held at the edge once produced.

**What it was capping exposure to is the part that was wrong.** This passage reasoned about a
monthly transformation quota and about a failure mode where exceeding it returns an error on new
conversions while already-cached ones keep serving. Both belong to the Cloudflare design the
first section of this file abandoned. A worker that decodes and re-encodes itself has no
per-image allowance to exceed: what a conversion costs is CPU in the worker, paid once per colo.
The preference that reasoning produced survives on the cheaper ground -- the request path a
browser takes by default is the stored object, and conversion is only ever the fallback.

## Exactly one picture in an article is given a priority hint

Every image on the page is `loading="lazy"`, which is right for the thirtieth and wrong for the one
the reader is already looking at. So the first picture gets `loading="eager"` and
`fetchpriority="high"`, and nothing else does.

**One, not the first few.** Priority is a ranking, and a ranking with no bottom has no top: hinting
three pictures mostly reorders them against each other. The hint is worth having because it says
_this one before everything else on the page_, which stops being true the moment it is shared.

**It is withheld unless the picture is near the top.** Counted in blocks -- the first three --
because blocks are what exists at build time. Pixels would be the right unit and are not available:
the hint has to be in the served HTML and where the fold falls depends on a viewport the server has
never seen. A picture within the first few blocks is above it on almost any screen; one further
down is a guess in both directions, and a wrong high priority costs more than a missing one.

**A clip cannot be hinted at all.** `fetchpriority` is defined for `img`, `link`, `script` and
`iframe`; a media element's own fetches are not covered by it, and a `fetchpriority` on `<video>`
is an attribute the browser ignores. `preload="metadata"` is the whole of what a clip's loading can
be told, and it already says the right thing.

**The three tiers above it are already in the right order and are not adjustable.** A stylesheet
in `<head>` is render-blocking and therefore in the browser's highest priority class before anyone
asks; the article's prose is not a resource at all but the document itself, arriving first by
definition -- measured at 277KB of HTML for a long article with the body inline; and the component
code is `modulepreload`, which is already below both. There is nothing to raise and nothing worth
lowering.

## Caching is the worker's job now

The old CDN served these files through a static-assets binding and set their cache policy in
a `_headers` file: `/fonts/*` for one year, `immutable`. That file has no equivalent once a
worker reads from R2, so the policy has to be reasserted in worker code or it is silently lost
-- the assets keep working while being re-fetched on every visit.

The trap inside the old policy was worth keeping in view for as long as it existed. Latin font
filenames carried no content hash -- `IoskeleyMono-Regular-latin.woff2` was a stable name -- so
declaring it `immutable` for a year promised that re-subsetting would produce a new filename,
while the CJK chunks beside it already carried hashes and needed no promise at all. Two shapes
under one prefix, and the policy had to keep both in mind.

**Every chunk is a content-addressed object now**, so the trap is gone rather than handled: there
is one shape, and the year it keeps is the year its name earns.

### And the policy is derived from the key, not decided per route

That trap generalises, and it is now the worker's one cache rule, which has three rows and no
exceptions: **a settled answer -- `2xx` or `3xx` -- keeps a year and `immutable` if its key carries
a hash and an hour if it does not; anything that is not a settled answer keeps five minutes.**
Nothing is looked up in a table, so a new object type arrives with the right policy and no decision
to remember.

The paragraph above was once the same statement made twice about fonts, and this is that
observation applied to every key the bucket holds. **Nothing keeps a long life without a hash any
more.** The Latin subsets were the only entry on that list and they joined the rest; a key wanting
to rejoin it has to arrive with its own written promise, and there is nothing to copy from.

The condition on the status is the half that is easy to omit, and easy to state too narrowly. A
`404` on a content-addressed key means the object was not uploaded or has been swept, and holding
that for a year would outlive the mistake by a very long way -- but a `304` is a successful
revalidation whose headers replace the ones already stored, so giving it five minutes shortens the
copy it was confirming. Failures get the five minutes; `2xx` and `304` keep the year. See
[artifacts.md](artifacts.md), "The key says what may cache it".

**This shortened three things that were not content-addressed and had been getting a week**:
another site's icon, the licence aggregate, and the assets no named route claimed. The week was
inherited from the `_headers` era and had never been argued for any of them individually.

Five minutes is the right number for the same reason the API's answers get five minutes: these
are published bytes, and the whole point of the arrangement above is that **publication has one
delay rather than a different one per resource**. A favicon a week stale while an article is five
minutes stale is two answers to one question.

**Every one of those three has since stopped needing the rule**, which is the better answer than
tuning a number: the icons, the notice and the cards are all content-addressed now and all keep a
year. An address that names rather than identifies keeps the hour that the middle row of the rule
above gives it -- the metadata bucket's root, and anything proxied. What is left on five minutes is
the refusals, and everything else that is not a settled answer.

### Development keeps no publication delay, and the judgement is made once

A publication delay is a promise to readers, and a laptop has none: there the five minutes is only
the distance between a rebuild and seeing it. So `PUBLICATION_DELAY` is zero in a development
bundle, and every number derived from it follows -- the site's held copy of an API answer, the
client query cache's staleness, and the `max-age` a worker stamps.

**The condition is in `libs/sdk/cache` and nowhere else.** Consumers read a number, never a condition,
which is the same reason the number itself is shared: eleven stamping sites each asking whether
they are in development is eleven chances for two of them to answer differently. `libs/sdk` takes
`isDev` as an argument instead, and that is right for it -- a worker reads its environment from the
request it is answering, and an address is a per-request question. A lifetime is not.

**It is the mode, not `DEV`.** Vite sets `DEV` under vitest too, so that spelling made a test run
exercise the development branch: all 22 assertions about the published header checked the number a
reader never gets, and the number they do get was checked by nothing. `MODE === 'development'`
separates the three cases, and wrangler's esbuild defines no `import.meta.env` at all -- so a
worker keeps the published numbers, which is right, because the caches it stamps for are real ones
even when it runs on a laptop.

## The CDN is four route groups and a refusal

**It resolves nothing, and that is enforced by what is mounted rather than by what is declared.**
Four groups reach a handler and everything else is a `400`:

| group                            | what it does                       | outbound |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| `/object/{cid}.{ext}`            | hands back the bytes at that key   | none     |
| `/derive/{cid}.{ext}.{ext}`      | every conversion and every archive | none     |
| `/proxy/{vendor}/**`             | a third party, live                | **yes**  |
| `/` `/favicon.ico` `/robots.txt` | this host's own three answers      | none     |

Beside them, `/github/**` answers `308` to `/proxy/github/**`, permanently, because the prefix
moved and a reader holding the old one should stop holding it.

**This replaced a route per object type.** `/image`, `/video`, `/captions`, `/content`, `/page`,
`/markdown` and `/license` are gone, and with them the table that said which types existed, the
`301` that corrected a mistyped one, and the test that failed when a type arrived unrouted. A type
in the path answered a question the extension already answers, and the bucket never stored one.

**`400` and `404` are not interchangeable here.** A `404` on a hashed name is a fact about the
bucket and a short-lived one; a path that is not one of the four shapes is a fact about the address
and will never become true. Collapsing them would throw away the only signal that distinguishes a
sweep from a typo.

**The catch-all is back and it refuses**, which is the opposite of the one that was removed. That
one answered for whatever happened to be in the bucket, which is how the records were served with a
year of `immutable` for as long as they shared it. This one reaches nothing: a prefix added
tomorrow is unreachable until somebody mounts it, and until then it is a refusal rather than a
lookup.

### What each lifetime is earned by

One rule over the four groups, and it reads the answer rather than the route:

| answered                           | kept                | because                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `2xx` or `3xx`, a hash in the path | a year, `immutable` | the hash is the bytes         |
| `2xx` or `3xx`, no hash            | an hour             | see below                     |
| anything else                      | five minutes        | a refusal is a fact about now |

**An hour is what an address that names rather than identifies earns.** What stands behind a name
can move -- a permanent name is answered by a different object when a mark is redrawn, a proxied
path by whatever the third party has now -- so the year is not available to it. But it does not
move on this site's publication clock either, and five minutes is that clock: giving it to
something this site does not publish would be asserting a delay that has nothing to do with the
thing. An hour says the address is stable and its answer is not.

Everything `public`. **A `3xx` keeps the year here, which no other host grants it**: a redirect
elsewhere is a fact about this moment, and on `/derive` it is a function of the input and can no
more change than the bytes can.

Two answers sit outside the rule and say so. `/favicon.ico` keeps a year with no hash in it -- the
one exception on this host, and it carries a promise: what moves is what the alias layer answers,
and that keeps its own five minutes. And a `502` from anything that had to reach another host is
`no-store`, because status alone cannot tell it from a `400` about a malformed address, and only
one of the two is worth forgetting immediately.

`/proxy` lost lifetimes of its own in the bargain. They said how fast somebody else's data moves --
a rolling tag against a version, an avatar against a release -- which is a real fact, and not one
worth a second rule. An avatar is now an hour stale rather than five minutes, and a `nightly`
likewise.

## Three layers, and the dependency runs one way

Four hosts answer, and three of them are a ladder.

|          | depends on                  | answers with |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| `cdn`    | nothing, except on `/proxy` | bytes        |
| `api`    | the metadata bucket         | records      |
| `ill.li` | `api`                       | a redirect   |
| `site`   | `api` + `cdn`               | pages        |

**Nothing below reaches upward.** The CDN can serve every byte it holds with the API down, which is
not a happy accident -- it is what content addressing buys, and asking the CDN to look anything up
would spend it. So resolution cannot live there, and that is what the third host is for.

That claim is about the bytes and is narrower than it reads: `/proxy` reaches a third party by
definition, and the day `/symlink` lived on the CDN it reached the API. Neither serves an object,
so `/object` answering with everything else down has stayed true throughout -- but it is worth
saying which half is guaranteed rather than leaving the sentence to carry more than it can.

`ill.li` is the hostname and `alias` is what the code calls it: the binding says what the layer
does, one name standing for another, and the host is the short form a reader sees. It was
`aka.ffoni.com` and the domain was `internal.link`, serving nothing -- `link` said nothing either,
because every URL is a link.

### The deployed name and the called name differ

**The worker is deployed as `aka`. Everything that calls it says `alias`, and keeps saying it.**
`URLS.internal.alias`, `DEVELOPMENT_PORTS.alias`, `DEVELOPMENT_PROXY_PATHS.alias`, the property
`upstream()` returns, every type and import: unchanged, and not pending.

The test for one occurrence is a question. **Does this name a thing that is deployed, or a thing
that is called?** A directory and a worker are deployed, so `apps/aka`, the `name` in its
`wrangler.jsonc`, the package name, and the `dev-aka` and `deploy-aka` tasks take `aka`. A property
on a URL map is called, so it stays `alias`. Prose splits the same way: a sentence that would still
be true if the worker had never been renamed is about the layer, and says `alias`.

Both names say the same thing, which is why neither is wrong and why this is not a half-finished
rename. The workspace's `naming.md` asks a member to be named in one word for its responsibility,
and `alias` already satisfies that -- the code had no reason to move. What changed is only the name
the deployment wears, said in the voice its siblings use: `press`, `still`, `seam`, `lattice`. A
layer whose whole job is one name standing for another is an _also known as_. The workspace's
`naming.md` already has this shape under "Vendor names stay at the edge" -- a name that differs at
a boundary, with the edge here on the other side.

### What this layer lets a cache keep

**Its answer is exactly as fresh as the answer behind it**, so a resolved redirect takes the life
the API's `/asset` answer takes and not a number of its own. Any other value would be a second
publication delay on one resource, which is the thing the ladder above exists to avoid.

The refusals split on one question, and it is not success against failure:

| `302`/`307`, resolved       | five minutes, `stale-if-error` | the life of the answer it wrapped                        |
| `404`, no such name         | five minutes                   | a fact about the corpus, true until the next publication |

| `500`                       | `no-store`                     | the same                                                 |

**`502` is the one that matters.** Every icon on a page comes through here, so a five-minute hold
on one unreachable upstream is an outage rather than a blip -- the same asymmetry the CDN keeps
between a `404` about its bucket and a `500` about its moment.

`stale-if-error` only appears here. This is the one host that must reach another to answer at all,
and a redirect it resolved earlier is a better answer during an outage than no answer -- the target
is content-addressed, so a stale one is still the bytes somebody asked for.

A middleware stamps the corpus lifetime on anything that named none, so a route added later cannot
answer without one.

### A name is resolved, never stored

This layer holds no bytes and no records. A request names something, it asks the API what that name
means right now, and it redirects to the CDN. That is the whole of it, and the emptiness is the
design: a layer that proxied bytes would be a second CDN with worse properties, and one that cached
records would be a second API that can disagree with the first.

**What belongs here is the resolution that cannot happen at build time.** An image an article owns
changes when the article changes, so its address is compiled into the article and needs nobody. A
favicon belongs to somebody else's site and changes on their schedule -- compiling that in would
mean republishing every article that mentions them the day they change their icon. The rule is the
asset's clock, not its kind: **resolve at build time what changes when the article changes, and at
request time what changes on somebody else's schedule.**

### Every answer is temporary, and the request decides which kind

A permanent redirect from here would be a promise about bytes this layer does not hold. So the
answer is always temporary, which leaves two codes, and what picks between them is whether the
request carried input.

| asked with   | answered | because                                                 |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| a path alone | `302`    | there is nothing to preserve; a `GET` stays a `GET`     |
| a query      | `307`    | the query is the question, and the answer depends on it |
| a body       | `307`    | a `302` is specified to let an agent discard it         |

**A path is not input.** It is the name being resolved, and it arrives at the CDN as a different
name anyway. `?tone=dark` is input: it selects among several answers, so the request is preserved
rather than merely followed.

### The whole chain, for a fixed asset

The site's own marks are published as content-addressed objects like anything else. The published
root names each one under the name a browser asks for, `/asset?name=` is the question the alias
layer puts to the API, and the name a reader sees never changes.

```
{host}/favicon.ico               302  cdn/object/{cid}.ico   followed for the browser, one hop
ill.li/symlink/{scope}/{file}    302  cdn/object/{cid}.{ext} what that name means right now
cdn/object/{cid}.{ext}                                       the bytes, for a year
```

**Every host answers its own `/favicon.ico` in one hop**: the site, the status page, the API, the
CDN and the alias layer itself each ask the alias layer for their own scope's mark and send the
browser straight to the object. There used to be a `301` to the alias layer in front of that, a
permanent name for where the entry lived; it was a second hop on every first visit for a fact no
reader needed, and it held each host's icon to the site's.

### A page follows the name for the browser

**A host asks the alias layer the name, takes the redirect it answers, and hands the browser that
object's address.** The status page answers every one of its marks this way, at `/{file}`.
`@monoflake/sdk/symlink` is the one way a host does this, and it stamps what the alias layer stamps:

| alias layer answers | page answers | kept for                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| a redirect          | `302` there  | `RESOLVED`: five minutes, stale for three hours after |
| `404`               | `404`        | `PUBLISHED`: five minutes, a fact about the corpus    |
| anything else       | `502`        | nothing: a fact about this moment                     |

**A head names its marks by the objects they resolve to at render.** The page's server asks the
alias layer for each mark its head names and writes the object's address straight into the markup,
so the browser fetches the bytes with no redirect at all; a mark that resolves to nothing is left
out of the head. Each answer is held in the server's memory for the publication delay, so a render
asks again at most every five minutes.

**A file a browser takes only from the page's own origin is served, not redirected to.** A sitemap's
XSL stylesheet is the case: `serveSymlink` follows the name and returns the bytes from the asking
origin, kept as long as the redirect would be.

**What a name means is the alias layer's alone.** A page knows the scope and file it asks for and
never the record behind it, and no page or worker writes down a content id: a mark changes by
publishing, not by redeploying anything.

### Every fixed name is a record

**`data/record/symlinks.json` names every scope's fixed names by content id** -- its marks, and any
other file a host answers under a name of its own, such as a sitemap's stylesheet -- and the bytes
are objects like any other, in the published tree and out of git. A scope is a service's internal name -- `site`,
`status`, `api`, `cdn`, `aka` -- never a host, since one service may be deployed under several, and
each of its files points at a content id; the extension is the file's. A service with no page names
only its `favicon.ico`. The alias layer answers each at `/symlink/{scope}/{file}`, which is what every page asks.
The site's are also answered bare, `/symlink/favicon.ico`, for the addresses already handed out:
every host's year-long `301` from `/favicon.ico`, and the BIMI record. Publication names each one
in the root and refuses to write a root that names an object the tree does not hold.

A new mark is its bytes put in the objects tree under their content id, and one line here. The marks
were files in git once, under `data/source/brand`; the bytes are in the bucket and its mirror, and
the record is what travels with the repository. The icons `local favicon` fetches from other sites
still travel as files, in `data/source/favicon`: re-fetchable in principle, but only from a site
that may have redrawn its icon since, so a clone without them cannot reproduce what is published.

### Another site's icon was the case this layer existed for, and it is a resource now

`ill.li/favicon/{domain}` kept the domain in the address, because that was what a link card could
construct from what it already knew and it was the half worth reading. **That argument is
retired**, and what replaced it is not a different address but a different question: an icon is a
resource, a card compiles to its rid, and a page asks the API what that rid currently means while
it renders -- so the domain is no longer something anything has to construct an address from. See
[resource.md](resource.md), "A rid is resolved three times, and each stage bakes only what it can
know".

The reason the route existed survives intact and is now served better. What an icon is still
changes when that site redraws it -- somebody else's schedule -- so it is still resolved per
request rather than compiled into every article that mentions them. What changed is who resolves
it: the page, on the path it already renders through, instead of a browser following a redirect
from a host that holds nothing. A card draws a CDN object address directly, one hop rather than
two, and this layer is left with the names a browser constructs on its own.

The half that was genuinely lost is readability: `/favicon/github.com` said what it was and
`/object/df8ece….svg` does not. That is the ordinary cost of content addressing, paid everywhere
else here already, and it buys the icon a year and `immutable` in exchange for five minutes.

`?tone=` was a query, which is why the route took the `307` in the table above. It is a key in the
record now and selects nothing over the network at all, so that row lost its only example here --
the rule stays because it is about requests, not about icons.

**A named tone is still that tone or nothing.** The rule moved with the files: it is stated once
in [resource.md](resource.md), "A layer keyed by name, and the absent key that says something",
and spelled on each side beside the record rather than in a worker.

Content addressing deduplicated them on the way in: a site whose light and dark icons are the same
file has one object, not two, named twice, without anything being written to notice that.

## Release assets are proxied, for one account

`/proxy/github/release/{repo}/{tag}/{asset}` serves a file attached to a GitHub release, fetched
live from `github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases/download/{tag}/{asset}` and held at the edge. The
older `/github/*` spelling is a method-preserving `308` to it and nothing more. `latest`
as the tag takes GitHub's own alias for the newest non-prerelease. jsDelivr already serves a
repository's files at a tag, a branch or a commit, so those are not proxied here; a release
asset is the one thing it does not carry.

**The account is not in the URL.** It is `GITHUB_OWNER` in `libs/sdk`, and there is no segment
in the CDN's path to name another, which is how "only my repositories" is enforced rather than
checked. A repository the account does not have, a tag that was never cut and an asset that was
never attached are all one answer from GitHub, 404, and the proxy says the same.

**A proxied file is a name, so it keeps the hour**, whatever its tag says. There was once a list
of moving tags here -- `nightly`, `latest` and six others -- held for five minutes while a version
took an hour. `/proxy` gave that up when the policy moved into the key, and the cost was accepted
rather than overlooked: an avatar and a `nightly` are each an hour stale now instead of five
minutes. A miss takes the CDN's usual five minutes, like every other refusal.

**A ranged download is answered from one upstream fetch.** The whole file is stored at the edge
under its plain URL, and the cache answers a `Range` request out of it with a 206, so a client
opening eight connections costs GitHub one transfer per colo rather than eight. A ranged request
that misses is answered from upstream as asked, and the whole file is fetched once behind it so
the connections that follow find it. Files past the edge cache's limit of 512 MB are passed
through unstored, ranges and all.

**The redirect is followed only onto GitHub.** The published address answers with a 302 to a
signed object URL, and following it is the whole mechanism; following it anywhere would make
this an open proxy the day that redirect changed, so the final host is checked. The headers that
describe the file -- type, length, disposition, `ETag`, `Last-Modified` -- are carried through;
the ones that described the upstream connection are not.

## Only ports 80 and 443 reach a worker

Cloudflare's proxy listens on thirteen ports, not two: 443, 2053, 2083, 2087, 2096 and 8443 for
HTTPS, and 80, 8080, 8880, 2052, 2082, 2086 and 2095 for HTTP. Every one of them reaches the same
worker. **A WAF custom rule in every zone blocks the other eleven**, the first clause of
`rules/all/block-probes.txt`:

```
not (cf.edge.server_port in {80 443})
```

80 stays so that "Always Use HTTPS" still has something to redirect. Every zone's `zone.toml`
lists the shared expression, so a zone added later has it by listing it too -- see
[firewall.md](firewall.md).

**The case that prompted it.** A scanner asked `https://canmi.net:8443/server-status`. The site's
catch-all took the hyphenated name for an article slug and asked the API, which correctly had no
such article. But SvelteKit sets `Origin` on a server-side `fetch` to the page's own origin,
which was `https://canmi.net:8443`, and the API's list names `https://canmi.net` with no port. So
the 404 came back without `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, SvelteKit's simulated CORS check threw,
and a missing article became a 500 reported to Sentry. Measured before the rule: the same path
was a 404 on 443 and a 500 on 8443.

**Rejected: teaching the API's origin list about ports.** It would repair the symptom and make
8443 a second address for the whole site, with every page served twice and neither redirecting to
the other. The site has one address, and the question of what the API should answer on a port
nobody publishes is better never asked. The rule closes it at the edge, before the worker, where
it costs no request and reports nothing.

## Every address has one spelling

**A request whose path is not in its one spelling is redirected to it**, the query kept. The
spelling -- CJK full stops, backslashes, runs of slashes, a trailing slash -- is `normalizePath` in
`@canmi/me/urls`, and `normalizedLocation` says where a request belongs and by which status, or
that it is already there; both are the package's, in the lib repository's `spec/me/addresses.md`,
"Every address has one spelling". Each entry point does the redirecting in its own framework's
terms, first,
before any route reads the path -- a Hono middleware on the gateway, the CDN and the alias layer, a
SvelteKit handle on the site, the status page and the panel, each with `trailingSlash = 'ignore'`
in its root layout, since SvelteKit's own redirect runs before any handle and would answer first. The CMS is a static build with no
server to redirect from, so it has none.

**The root is the bare host.** `/` alone and `/` with a query are already where they belong and
are never redirected: the bare host goes on the wire as `GET /`, so no server can tell the two
apart, and a redirect from one to the other would loop. Any other spelling of the root alone --
`//`, `/\` -- goes to the bare host itself, `https://canmi.net` with no slash, by a 301; with a
query it goes to `/?` and the query. Every other path goes by a 308, which keeps the method, so an
API call that was misspelled arrives as the call it was.

A browser already turns a backslash into a slash before it sends an `http` address, so that half of
the rule is for a client that does not.
