# The gateway: one entrance for every API

The gateway is infrastructure; the site and the status page are its consumers. Every API this
repository runs is reached through one Worker, `gateway`, and nothing else. What it adds is
everything a service would otherwise write again: where a request goes, CORS, how long an answer
is kept, whether a credential is needed, and the files every host answers for. A service is
business logic and one declaration the gateway reads.

The move to it is done but for milestones E7 and E13 in
[../todo/milestones.md](../todo/milestones.md); what is left is listed in
[../issues/gateway.md](../issues/gateway.md). Where [services.md](services.md) or
[delivery.md](delivery.md) say something else about the hosts, this file wins.

## The gateway is infrastructure, and pages are not

**A page is a consumer of the gateway, never behind it.** The site on `canmi.net` and the status
page are applications that call APIs; they keep their own hosts and their own Workers. What of
them is an API -- the site's `/site/` routes -- is a service like any other, and reaches the public
through the gateway. Mixing the two would let a page's concerns -- its titles, its hydration --
into the layer every API depends on.

**There is one gateway Worker.** The public API host, the CDN and the alias layer were three
Workers each repeating CORS, cache stamps, `robots.txt`, `security.txt`, `favicon.ico` and the
path rule. In the gateway they are written once; the CDN and the alias layer become services
behind it, reached by binding, with no route of their own.

## Every request is one address, written several ways

**The gateway reads every request into one tuple: the service, the version, where it runs, and
the path.** Each hostname the gateway answers is a profile: it says which parts of the tuple the
hostname gives, which the path gives, and which it fills in itself. The service sees only the
version and the path, and never which hostname or profile the request came by.

**The version goes to the service as part of the path, untouched.** A service handles its own
versions, routing `/v1/...` and, one day, `/v2/...` itself; the gateway reads the version only to
fill it in. A profile that pins one -- `cdn.monoflake.com` at `v3` -- puts `/v3` in front of the
path, so the CDN receives `/v3/object/...` whichever host was asked.

| Hostname                                | The hostname gives              | The path gives           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `api.monoflake.com`                     | nothing                         | `/v{n}/{service}/{path}` |
| `cdn.monoflake.com`                     | the service, `cdn`, at `v3`     | `/{path}`                |
| `ill.li`                                | the service, `aka`, at `v1`     | `/{rid}`, a short link   |
| `symlink.si`                            | `aka` at `v1`, under `/symlink` | `/{path}`                |
| `api-{region}-{provider}.ixc.one`       | where it runs                   | `/v{n}/{service}/{path}` |
| `{service}-{region}-{provider}.ixc.one` | the service, and where it runs  | `/v{n}/{path}`           |

**`monoflake.com` lets the gateway choose where a request runs; `ixc.one` names it.** The two are
the same services behind the same rules, so a caller may use either: the first is the address to
publish, the second the one to pin a node, debug one, or -- later -- for a client that has measured
which node is nearest and asks it directly. A page rendered on the server would use
`monoflake.com`, so that what it renders can always be reached.

### A second domain answers the same

**`monoflake.net` answers everything `monoflake.com` does**: `api.monoflake.net` and
`cdn.monoflake.net` are the same profiles as their `.com` twins, with the same rules, crawlers
included. `.com` is the one published; `.net` is a way round the day a registry, a registrar or a
resolver fails one of them, since two top-level domains are run by two registries. That both
serve the same bytes is no concern of the service layer's -- see "A host admits crawlers or does
not". `ixc.one` has no second: a deployment's own host is for pinning, not for publishing.

**A profile is a row in a table, not code.** A new short host, or a new node, is one more row: the
hostname, what it fixes, the version it pins, and the path it puts in front, if any.
`symlink.si/{path}` reaches the alias layer as `/v1/symlink/{path}`, and `ill.li` carries short
links. `ill.li` is pinned at `v1`, where the alias layer answers a short link and, still, the old
`/symlink/...` a mark was once asked at, for the addresses already handed out.

**The alias layer's code is `aka`**, the name its Worker and its directory have always had: short,
and what it has been called everywhere it is named.

## Hostnames are one label deep, spelled with hyphens

**A deployment is `{service}-{region}-{provider}.ixc.one`, not `{service}.{region}.{provider}`.**
Every name is then one label under `ixc.one`, which one wildcard certificate covers -- Cloudflare's
free certificate covers the apex and one level and no deeper, as does a wildcard certificate
anywhere, since no browser accepts a wildcard over two labels. More than the certificate, nearly
every system is built for one level of wildcard -- DNS records, tunnels, Access, routes -- so one
level is the shape that fits all of them. And it costs nothing here: the gateway splits a hostname
by its codes, not by DNS's levels, and every hostname is already its own key in every cache.

**A hostname is read from the right.** The last part is the provider and the one before it the
region, both short fixed codes; whatever is left is the service, hyphens and all.

### Providers are short codes, registered here

A provider is two or three lowercase letters, chosen once when the provider is first used and never
reused: `int` for our own machines, `cf` for Cloudflare, `vcl` for Vercel. A new provider is a row
added to the registry before anything is placed on it. The registry is `GATEWAY` in `libs/sdk`, beside
the hostnames themselves, and the regions are kept in the same place; the gateway reads a
deployment's hostname against it in `apps/edge/gateway/src/profile.ts`.

### Regions are where a deployment runs

A region is three lowercase letters: the IATA code of the airport nearest the machine, or, where
that says less, the city's own code or a datacenter's well-known one -- whichever the reader would
recognize first. A deployment that runs everywhere at once, as a Worker does, is `glo`.

| Code  | Where                                            | So a deployment there is                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `rdu` | the machine at home, by Raleigh-Durham's airport | `api-rdu-int.ixc.one`, `geo-rdu-int.ixc.one` |
| `glo` | Cloudflare's Workers, everywhere                 | `api-glo-cf.ixc.one`                         |

## A version is in the path, and it moves only on a break

**Every API path starts with `/v{n}/`.** Every service starts at `v1` -- except the CDN, which
starts at `v3`, and the alias layer at `v1`, because the CDN has already been rebuilt twice and
saying so is the honest number.

**A version moves only when its input stops being a superset of the last.** If everything the old
version accepted is still accepted and answered as before, a change is an extension, however
large, and the version stays. A version moves when some request the old one accepted would now be
refused or answered differently. What the old version does after a break -- keep answering through
a compatibility layer, or answer with a status that tells the client to upgrade -- is decided when
the first break comes.

**A short host pins its version, and never follows the latest.** `cdn.monoflake.com` is `v3` and
`ill.li` is `v1` until somebody changes that row on purpose. Their addresses are written into
articles, mail and other people's pages, which outlive any version; following the latest would
break every one of them on the day a version moves. A caller that wants a newer version asks for it
by path, on `api.monoflake.com`.

## What a service declares, and what the gateway does with it

**A service declares; the gateway enforces.** The declaration is the service's `service.toml`,
which the gateway's table is generated from, and nothing about a service's contract is written in
the gateway. For the service and, where it differs, for each of its paths, it says who may call it
from a browser, how long a success and a failure are kept, whether a crawler may fetch it, and what
limits it, as a bucket counted by [`quota`](quota.md). The service itself sees a request that has already been checked, with the
version and the path, and writes none of it.

**A route names who may call it by service code, never by origin.** `cors` is `public`, for any
origin, or a list of the codes of the services whose pages may call it -- `["site", "status"]` --
which the gateway reads against `libs/sdk` for their origins. A page moving to another host is
then one change in `libs/sdk`, and no declaration names a URL.

**Every field is declared for the service, and may be declared again for any one of its paths.**
CORS, lifetimes, crawling and, later, credentials are all route-level: a service's defaults say
what its paths get, a route says what it gets instead, and the nearest declaration wins.

**A lifetime is declared for five kinds of answer, named rather than numbered.** A success is a
`2xx` or a `3xx`, a failure a `4xx` or a `5xx` -- the request's fault, or the service's, an answer
that never came counting as the service's. A `202` is a success of its own: the request was taken
and is not done, so the answer is about this moment, where a `200` from the same route may be
settled. Each has a name, nested under success and failure, so a route can keep a redirect apart
from what it points at, a task still queued apart from a task done, and a blip apart from a refusal
that holds until the next publication:

| Class | Name                 | What it says                                |
| ----- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `2xx` | `success.fulfilled`  | the request was met; every `2xx` but `202`  |
| `202` | `success.accepted`   | the request was taken and is not done       |
| `3xx` | `success.redirected` | the answer is elsewhere                     |
| `4xx` | `failure.rejected`   | the request was at fault                    |
| `5xx` | `failure.faulted`    | the service was at fault, or never answered |

A lifetime is written `"30s"`, `"15m"`, `"1h"` or `"1d"`; `"immutable"` is a year and says the
bytes will not change; `"none"` keeps nothing.

**What nobody declares falls to one default: a success is kept fifteen minutes, a failure five,
and an accepted request not at all**, since a `202` is never more than a moment's answer.

### The declaration

`[api.defaults]` holds what every path of the service gets; each `[[api.routes]]` names a `path`
and what it gets instead. Each field is looked up on the route, then the service's defaults, then
the gateway's own, field by field, so a route that names one lifetime inherits the other four.

```toml
[api.defaults]
crawlable = false

[api.defaults.cors]
origins = "public"            # or service codes: ["site", "status"]
methods = ["GET", "HEAD"]     # the default when absent
headers = []                  # request headers allowed beside Content-Type

[api.defaults.cache.success]
fulfilled = "15m"
accepted = "none"
redirected = "15m"

[api.defaults.cache.failure]
rejected = "5m"
faulted = "none"

[[api.routes]]
path = "/symlink/*"

[api.routes.cache.success]
redirected = "1h"
```

- **`cors` absent is no browser at all.** `origins` is `"public"` or a list of service codes,
  `methods` defaults to `GET` and `HEAD`, `headers` to none beyond `Content-Type`. A route that
  says `cors = false` takes away what its defaults gave; `cors` is replaced whole, not merged.
- **A path is written after the version.** `/address` is every version's `/address`; the version
  is the service's to route on, and a route holds across versions until one says otherwise.
- **`exposed = false` makes a path no address at all**, refused before the service is asked, and
  left out of the host's whitelist. A service that opens one route of many sets it false in
  its defaults and true on that route.
- **`forbidden` lists query parameters, or JSON keys anywhere in a body, the public may not
  send**: what a service offers our own callers alone, until accounts say so instead.
- **A path is exact, or a prefix ending in `/*`.** The more specific wins -- exact over prefix, the
  longer prefix over the shorter -- whatever the order they are written in; two routes as specific
  as each other are an error when the table is generated.
- **A limit's path is written as a route's is**: after the version, exact or a prefix ending in
  `/*`, and the same row is matched alike by the gateway before it asks `quota`, by Caddy on the node -- which
  matches it with or without a version in front -- and by host when it refuses two rows of one kind
  that would count one call twice. Each row counts one kind of subject, and rows of different kinds covering one
  call stack -- see [quota.md](quota.md), "A key names the service, the route and the subject,
  never a host".
- **`auth` is reserved.** It takes `"none"` alone until there are accounts.

### The table is built, not read at run time

`mise run scopes` reads every `service.toml`, holds each public scope's to a schema -- an unknown field, a service
code nobody declares, a lifetime it cannot read and two routes as specific as each other all fail
it -- and writes the gateway's table as `apps/edge/gateway/src/scopes.ts`, lifetimes in seconds and
routes in the order they are matched. The gateway reads nothing else at run time, and a test holds
the committed table to the declarations. A Worker cannot read the repository, and a store it read
at run time would be state that drifts from the code and is checked only once it is live; a change
to a declaration is a commit either way, and Cloudflare rebuilds the gateway on it.

**Onboarding a service is a declaration, never gateway code.** Its `service.toml`, `mise run
scopes`, and for a Worker the binding in the gateway's `wrangler.jsonc`, which a test checks.
host's reader of the same file ignores what it does not know, so the gateway's fields cost the
nodes nothing.

**Whether a crawler may fetch a path is declared with it.** The gateway writes each hostname's
`robots.txt` from what the routes reachable on that host say -- the CDN may let its objects be
indexed while the rest of the API is not.

**A consumer is not behind the gateway, and keeps calling the libraries.** The site's routes are
its own and unlike any API's, so the site, and the status page, still answer their own
`robots.txt` and `security.txt`, declared in web and built by `@canmi/me/robots` as the gateway's
are. That is one package called from two repositories, not the rules written twice.

**An answer's lifetime is declared per route, and a success and a failure are declared apart.**
One lifetime for every answer -- five minutes, success or failure -- is too coarse: some failures
are facts that hold until the next publication, and some are a blip that must not be kept at all.
A route says how long each of these is kept: an answer, a refusal about the request itself, and
the service failing or being unreachable.

**A range is never kept.** A request asking for part of what an address names, and a `206`
answering it, pass the gateway's cache by: kept under the whole address, a part would be served as
the whole to the next reader. The lifetime still goes on to the browser, which keeps ranges as
ranges.

**Whether an object can be read is the route's to say, not the object's.** Objects are content
addressed and stored once, so a content id says what the bytes are and nothing about who may have
them. A route that serves an object to anyone answers `public, immutable`; a route that serves it
on some condition is kept by that route's own rule. When accounts exist, the condition is a
credential; until then every route is public.

## The gateway declares its hosts in its `wrangler.jsonc`

Attached in the dashboard,
`api.ffoni.com` was gone after a deploy that followed its move from the old API Worker -- the DNS
record went with it, and the first sign was the host not resolving. Declared, every deploy asserts
them, and a custom domain left out of the list is detached by the deploy, its DNS record with it.
The other Workers' domains are still the dashboard's, and move the same way if one goes.

**A zone that is the gateway's alone is one wildcard route; an apex is a custom domain.**
`monoflake.com`, `monoflake.net` and `ixc.one` serve nothing but the gateway below
their apex, so each is `*.{zone}/*` over a proxied `*` record, and a host the profiles add needs no
change here or in the dashboard -- one the profiles do not know is refused by the gateway and its
whitelist. A route matches no apex, so `ill.li` and `symlink.si`, which are their apexes, are
custom domains. The wildcard record exists before the deploy that drops a custom domain on it,
since the explicit record goes with the domain and the wildcard is what answers after.

## Every host's files and firewall are derived

**A domain is the application layer's or the service layer's.** `canmi.net`, `canmi.app` and the
status page's hosts are applications, configured each as itself. Every hostname bound to the
gateway is the service layer's, and nothing about it is written by hand: what it answers is the
profile table and the declarations, and everything a host says about itself follows from those.

**What a hostname serves is known exactly, so each host's files are its own.** The gateway knows,
for every hostname, which paths are an address there: the profile's fixed parts and every route of
the services it reaches. From that one set it writes the host's `robots.txt` -- a path allowed where
its route is `crawlable`, refused otherwise -- its `/.well-known/security.txt`, its `/favicon.ico`,
and the redirect of a path to its one spelling. No two hosts answer the same file unless they serve
the same paths.

### A host admits crawlers or does not

**The service layer says whether a crawler may fetch, never whether something is indexed twice.**
Each profile says whether its host admits crawlers at all: an API host -- `api.monoflake.com` and a
deployment's own under `ixc.one` -- refuses every one, whatever its routes say; the CDN, the short
links and the symlinks -- `cdn.monoflake.com`, `ill.li`, `symlink.si` -- admit them as far as
their routes are `crawlable`, since what they lead to is public and a crawler reading a page is
better for reaching what the page shows. A
retired host answers as the host it was replaced by. That two hosts serve the same bytes is the
application layer's concern, where pages are; here there are none.

**A host that admits crawlers everywhere says so with nothing refused.** Where every service a host
reaches is crawlable by default, its robots.txt lists only what is refused, and an empty `Disallow:`
when nothing is -- never `Allow` lines over a `Disallow: /`. Twitterbot reads the 1994 draft, which
has no `Allow`, and would see only the refusal: a card's picture on the CDN went unfetched once for
exactly that.

**The firewall's whitelist is to be generated from the same set, and synced by the same script.**
A service-layer zone's rules in `rules/` -- which paths each of its hosts lets through to a Worker
at all -- are to be written by `mise run scopes` beside the table, never by hand, so the WAF refuses
exactly what the gateway would and opens nothing wider. That is milestone E7 and not built: today
`mise run scopes` writes the table and the `[edge]` block, and the whitelists are written by hand.
`mise run rules sync` sends them to Cloudflare as it does every zone's. An application-layer zone's
rules stay written by hand. See [firewall.md](firewall.md).

## Where a request goes

**A service runs on Workers or on a node, and the gateway merges them into one set of routes.** A
service on Workers is reached by binding; a service on a node is reached through Cloudflare Tunnel.
Choosing among several placements of one service -- by load, by distance -- is the gateway's later,
and the reason `monoflake.com` does not name one.

**A caller off the node uses the public names; what runs on the node keeps the private side.** A
device, a page, a third party asks `api.monoflake.com` and the `ixc.one` names, which the house's
resolver answers with the node at home. A service on the node asking another -- `cron` at a job's
time, a service pushing to the ledger, the probe's inside checks -- asks the private side
[services.md](services.md) describes, `api.internal.ixc.one/{scope}/...`, through Caddy, which
admits the node's own containers and counts no limit; those calls are our own and are given no
versions. The private suffix moved there from `canmi.icu` when the token Caddy proves certificates
with stopped covering that domain.

**A Worker behind the gateway asks another by binding, never through the gateway's host.** The
gateway reaching a Worker that then asks the gateway's own public name is a request in a circle,
and Cloudflare refuses it; the alias layer asks the site's public routes by the site's binding,
under the API host's name so the site reads it as the public door. The gateway resolves its own
marks through the alias layer's binding for the same reason.

### Inside the house, the same names answer locally

**The gateway is one program deployed twice.** On Workers it is the Worker `gateway`; on the node it
is the same code under a Node entry point, in a container beside Caddy, on the newest stable Node
rather than its long-term line. CORS, lifetimes, crawling, each host's files, the path rule and,
later, credentials are one implementation, so a service never knows, and never needs to know, which
side reached it. The two entry points differ in what they are handed and nothing else: the Worker
its bindings, the Node entry the same names as HTTP -- `HOME` and `QUOTA` asked on Caddy's inside
side, `RELAY` and `INTERNAL_TOKEN` from its environment. The deployment at home mirrors the one on
Workers, so what a caller meets is the same on both.

**Caddy answers the gateway's hostnames on the LAN and hands them to it.** Its private side carries
every hostname the profiles read, with certificates by DNS challenge, as it already has for
the private suffix; the internal gateway behind it reads each request into its tuple as the Worker does.
Caddy sets `Cf-Connecting-Ip` to the LAN address it was asked from, over whatever the caller sent,
so the internal gateway counts each device as the public one counts each visitor.
The LAN's DNS -- infra's resolver -- answers those names with the node, so a device at home
reaches the internal gateway by name.

**A service on the node is asked on the node; a service on Workers is asked through the public
gateway.** What runs at home -- a deployment under `ixc.one` placed `rdu-int`, and every service
whose placement is the node -- goes to Caddy's inside side without leaving the house; see
infra's `spec/architecture/host.md`, "The inside side answers the internal gateway alone". What
runs on Workers has no copy here, so the request goes on to the public gateway under the API
host's spelling, `api.monoflake.com/v{n}/{service}/...`, resolved by public DNS rather than the
LAN's, so a LAN that answers the names locally never sends the gateway to itself.

**What the internal gateway sends out carries `INTERNAL_TOKEN`**, in `x-internal`, a secret in the
repository's secrets and in both gateways' environments. Each service-layer zone's firewall lets a
request carrying it past the rate rule, as it does the probe's, and the public gateway takes the
header off before any service sees it and does not count the call again: it was counted where it
entered. Everything else -- CORS, lifetimes, credentials -- the public gateway applies as to any
call. See [quota.md](quota.md), "Deployed twice, counted where a request enters".

**The internal gateway keeps no answers at first.** It states the same lifetimes, so a browser and
every cache after it keep what they would from the public one; a store of its own on the node is
added when a reason is.

**The LAN's DNS answers the names**, through infra's resolver. The private side,
`api.internal.ixc.one`, is still what the node's own callers use -- the ledger, cron, the probe's
private checks -- and retiring it is a step not yet taken.

**Telling our own callers from the public stays as it is until there are accounts.** What a
service offers only to our own callers is told today by which side reached it. When the account
system issues tokens, a `system` user's token will say the same thing, and the two may be unified
then.

## A domain leaves without a redirect

**A domain being retired is a profile that proxies, not one that redirects.** Its hosts stay
bound to the gateway, as profiles that read their old addresses into the new tuple and answer as
the new hosts would. A link to them keeps working, unchanged, with no 301 for a client to follow
or a cache to remember. A retired host is pinned at the version its old paths were spelled for, so
what kept its shape answers there still, and a route that changed shape with its first version
does not. Once every caller here has moved, the rows and the route are deleted, the domain goes
quiet, and it is released.

`ffoni.com` left this way. `cdn.ffoni.com` and `api.ffoni.com` were such profiles --
`api.ffoni.com/geo/ip` read as `/v1/geo/ip` -- until rdm, the last caller, asked
`cdn.monoflake.com` instead; their rows, the gateway's route and `rules/ffoni.com` were deleted on 2026-10-04, and nothing here routes to or calls the domain.
