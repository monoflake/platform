# Relay: three nodes decide, every node passes it on

Where the platform's control messages are going, and none of it is built. Today a finished run
reaches nodes as one notice per node, sent once by `hook` -- [services.md](services.md), "Every node
is the same node"; a node that was away then never hears of it.

## Three nodes agree, and the rest pass it on

**Three core nodes, one per failure domain, decide what happened: `tyo`, `buf` and `gvx`.** A
message is committed once two of the three have confirmed it, and committed messages form one log,
numbered in order and never rewritten. The nodes and their domains are infra's
`spec/architecture/nodes.md`; three in three domains survive the loss of any one account.

**Every other node is a relay.** It keeps the log, and passes it on to whoever asks. A node does not
care where it heard a message: it compares how far its log goes with a neighbor's and takes what it
lacks. One number says whether a node is behind, because the log is in one order -- which is what
deciding among three first buys.

**A committed entry is signed by the core**, so a relay can carry it and cannot forge it. Any node
taken over can withhold messages, never invent one.

**A node that was away catches up by the same comparison**, from whichever neighbor it reaches
first, which is what makes a node allowed to go offline -- `home` -- whole again when it returns.

## What travels on it

A run that finished is the first message: `hook` hands it to the core instead of to every node. What
a run built can follow the same way: GitHub records each artifact's digest, so a node can take the
bytes from a neighbor and check them, and a node without IPv4 then needs nothing from GitHub.

## The order it is built in

1. **A port on the tailnet.** host gives an app a shape that listens on the node's tailnet address
   alone -- infra's `spec/todo.md`.
2. **The log, with one writer.** `hook` writes to one core node, and every node gossips the log and
   catches up by it. A node that was away no longer misses a run.
3. **Three writers.** The one writer becomes the three, an entry committed by two of them.

Which consensus and which gossip is open -- [../issues/relay.md](../issues/relay.md).
