# Console: every node at once, served at the edge

**It is leaving the platform.** The console is a services app, and it moves to web and stays at the
edge alone, while infra's per-node panel retires -- web's `spec/roadmap.md`, "One console runs the
system, and it is this layer's". What follows holds until it has moved, and moves with it.

The platform's view of itself: every node, and what CI is building. When the edge is down, a node is
reached over the tailnet instead, by SSH and a task that speaks host's API.

## The UI is at the edge, the data is the nodes'

**The console is a SvelteKit app rendered on Cloudflare, at the edge**, behind Access, so it is as
near the reader as Cloudflare is, and it holds no data. A page's first paint is rendered by the
Worker from what the nodes answer: the cluster from the nearest relay's `/state`, and a node's own
readings from its host's API, reached through that node's VPC binding at Caddy's door to host,
`infra.<suffix>`, with the read token. The Worker reads its bindings from `cloudflare:workers`, since SvelteKit's
`event.platform` is empty under its Cloudflare adapter, and runs with `nodejs_compat`, which
SvelteKit's server needs.

**The page and its live socket are one Worker on one host, `console.canmi.app`.** `/live`, `/state`
and `/nearest` are answered in the server hook before any page: the Worker picks the nearest node
from where Cloudflare says the reader is and hands the request to that node's relay by its VPC
binding, the next node when it fails. A response the hook returns itself leaves SvelteKit as it
was made, which a WebSocket's 101 must, and does: a browser saw the 101 on 2026-10-06. One host because Access sets its cookie per concrete
hostname and cannot set one ahead for a wildcard application's subdomains, and a WebSocket cannot
follow Access's redirect to get one: a page on one name could not open a socket on another --

**It is dark, drawn with semantic names** -- ground, surface, line, text, good, warn, danger and
the series -- that a palette fills: the kit's Nord defines them, and for now the console points the
surfaces, lines and states at the kit's black and white `mono.css`, Nord keeping the series, so the
layout is tuned without color before color comes back. Its charts
are drawn as SVG by the app itself with d3's scales and shapes, so the server renders them whole:
a chart library drawing on a canvas would paint nothing until the browser ran it.

**The shell is three fixed regions, and only the page scrolls.** The sidebar runs down the whole
left edge with its rule, the top bar sits right of it alone, and the page between them is the one
scrolling element; the document itself never scrolls or bounces. Their sizes are in `rem`, so the
three keep their proportions as the reader's text size changes. The top bar carries the scope on its left, the page's
name at its center and the page's actions on its right -- creating something, and whatever comes
later -- and nothing else; whether the console is live sits at the foot of the sidebar.

**The console is read whole, or in one of three scopes, the layers the workspace's
`spec/architecture/layers.md` draws.** `All` is the default and has no segment of its own -- `/`,
`/nodes`, `/apps` -- and shows everything together; the scopes narrow it: `Infra` -- host, keeper, Caddy and what else bootstraps
a node, and the nodes themselves -- then `Platform`, the services every layer above leans on, and
`Services`, what the author deploys on top. A scope is the address's first segment, so a link
keeps it, and every page shows what belongs to the scope it is read in; the nodes are infra's, and
shown under `Infra` and `All`. An app's scope is the layer whose repository built it. Rules come in two levels: the
shell's own a step fainter (`--color-line-faint`), the page's cards and tables at `--color-line`. A page says what it is in its
title and the facts beside it -- never a sentence about the page, under it or under a card. Its
`<title>` is the one name the page is about and nothing around it -- `Nodes`, `tyo`, `#123`, an
app's name -- with no product name and no separator: the console is behind Access and indexed by
nobody, so a title is for a reader picking out a tab, and the shortest name does that best. Its
icons are the `console` scope's marks, the API's own, followed for the browser as every page's are.

**Moving between pages never waits for a node.** A page's `load` returns at once: what it reads
from the nodes it returns as promises SvelteKit streams, and the page awaits each where it is
drawn, so a click shows the new page's layout, headings and cards in the same frame and each card
fills as its read lands. The server renders that layout whole -- the first response is the page,
never an empty shell -- and a chart that cannot be drawn on the server is drawn by the browser
inside a card the server already placed. A tab is a link like any other and obeys the same rule.

**Every time is written in the reader's zone**, which Cloudflare names on the request, set once in
the layout and read by every chart, so the server and the browser write the same text and the
page does not change as it wakes; a zone Intl does not know falls back to UTC. **The world map is
projected when the console is built**, flat and as a grid of dots, so neither the Worker nor the
browser carries a projection or a world's topology -- only the dots it drew. A globe is offered
beside it and loaded only when asked for, being WebGL the server cannot draw. On both, a node's mark
says how much it runs and how busy it is: its size says how much machine stands at its place -- the
memory of every node there together, up to 2 GiB, under 8, or 8 and more, so one large machine and many
small ones read alike -- its depth steps with the apps running on it from faint to solid, and a halo breathes around it faster as its CPU
climbs -- still when the reader asks for reduced motion. A node has two states on the map, and its whole mark takes the state's color: blue when it
is heard, red when it is gone. Late is not a state but a node between two snapshots, and is drawn
as heard. The
smallest step is two of the land's dots across, so a mark reads as part of the same grid. No line is drawn between nodes,
and no name: a node's code and figures appear in a card on hover. **A mark is a place, not a machine**: nodes in one
place -- Tokyo's three -- are one mark, its depth from the apps they run together, its breath from
the busiest of them, red if any is gone, and its card listing each node.

**Developing it reads the real nodes.** Each node's binding is declared `remote`, so `vite dev`
reaches the same VPC services the deployed Worker does, with the read token in a `.dev.vars` written
from infra's sops file and never printed -- `mise run //repos/platform:dev-console` writes it when
missing. Vite keeps every WebSocket upgrade for its own reload, so in development alone a plugin
takes `/live`, admits only the dev server's own `localhost` origin, and joins the browser to the
nearest relay's socket; none of it is in the build.

**It reads, and does not write, at first.** Each node's host gains a read-only token, good for its
`GET` routes alone, and that is the token the console's path carries; a host token is root on its
machine, and seven of them in one Worker would make the Worker root on all seven. Restarting,
deploying and rolling back are `mise run node` over the tailnet until writes have a path of their
own.

**It depends on the platform and a node does not**, which is the arrangement the workspace's
`spec/architecture/layers.md` allows: a node is reached over the tailnet when the console is not.

## Live, through the nearest node

**A reader's browser holds one WebSocket, to the node nearest it, and the nodes hold connections to
each other**, so whichever node a reader reached has everything as it happens. That is the relay's
mesh carrying live state beside its log -- [relay.md](relay.md) -- and it needs what the relay's
first step needs, a port on the tailnet. **Workers VPC carries the WebSocket**: the console's Worker
hands the upgrade to the nearest node's binding and gets the relay's 101 back, seen from a browser
on 2026-10-06. While the socket is down the page polls `/state`.

## The pipeline

**What CI is building, what it built, and where each node is with it** are one view: a run queued,
building, built or failed on GitHub; then on each node, the artifact downloaded, loaded, started,
checked healthy, or failed at one of those, or skipped for its architecture or its placements. The
GitHub half comes from `hook`, which receives every run's events and today drops all but a
successful completion; the node half from host, which records each stage as it happens.
