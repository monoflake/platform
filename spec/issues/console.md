# Issues: the console

What [../architecture/console.md](../architecture/console.md) leaves open. The rules over an entry
are the index's; see [issues.md](issues.md).

## Where the console learns a node's facts

A node's tier, failure domain, expiry year and system are infra's, in its `nodes/nodes.toml`, and
the console needs them for the node table and each node's header. Today
`apps/edge/console/src/lib/nodes/facts.ts` copies them by hand, so a node added or retired in infra
leaves the console wrong until somebody edits both. Each node's host could serve its own row, the
relay could carry the table with the snapshots, or the build could read the file from infra; each
moves where the fact is held, and none is chosen.

## Whether the console switches between palettes

The console draws with semantic names and today points them at the kit's black and white palette,
with Nord's values set aside until the layout is settled -- see
[../architecture/console.md](../architecture/console.md). Both could stay, chosen by the reader as
the status page chooses light and dark, which would make every palette a mapping onto the same
names, and the kit would carry that mapping rather than each app. Whether to switch, where the
choice is kept, and whether the series change with the palette are undecided.
